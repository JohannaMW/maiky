"I found myself within a labyrinth where music took my hand and lead me through a dream world where fantasy and reality happend simultaneously. A unique experience which seemed to me like a lucid dream." Nicholas Z.

"I never had a similar experience in any opera (and I have seen a lot of them). We followed the characters and the music close around in the very emotion-awakening building. It was like moving around in my own unconsciousness. Discovering new areas inside and outside. The musicians and singers acting close together made magic sounds corresponding again with my inner life. And the costumes fulfilled this dreamworld that still lives in me and inspires my fantasy!" Annelita M.

                "One of the most arresting experiences I had during Schnitzler’s Dreams was sitting in the grand
hall of the Fredrikstad Bibliotek and listening to the faint echo of four different voices floating in
from further reaches of the building. I felt as if I was in a haunted past remembered from old novels,
yet experienced in real time. The combining of opera with immersive theatre allows the viewer to
experience not just the dramaturgy, but the music itself in different ways. In Schnitzler’s Dreams
one is allowed to create duets and trios out of solos, to hear faint discordant harmonies in echos, or
sit almost alone in a large hall with a whispering polyphony." Robert M.J.

"...As a bonus, the work lives out of its original frame, and becomes a presence to the streets around
the venue. Everybody walking by can hear the complaints of these wanderers, and picture
themselves their journey, letting themselves fantasize on what’s behind the wall, behind the
window." Corentin J.P.M.L.

            <p>The performative Opera Installation „Schnitzler`s Dreams“ will be shown at the newly renovated Aula at the library in
                Fredrikstad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on texts by 19th century writer Arthur Schnitzler and a collection of existing classical music, this work will lead
                the audience into the depth of the unconsciousness. Similar to a hotel, this installation accommodates the different
                characters and the dreams worlds they carry within themselves. Like dream-walkers the characters move through the
                rooms which are different worlds. Their emotional state and their thoughts are revealed when they sing inner
                monologues extracted from texts by Arthur Schnitzler, accompanied by musicians who play newly composed music
                based on well-known pieces of classical music, mainly from the world of opera.
            </p>
            <p>
                It offers opera as a journey for the audience. A network of different stories that proceed partly independently, partly
                depending on each other will develop. Deep hidden worlds and inner conflicts of the characters will be revealed. The
                experience of the piece begins for the audience with their entrance in this dream uni- verse and ends with their leaving.
                The audience enters this closed universe as a visitor. A duration of three hours is estimated for the installation where
                the audience is free to leave anytime.
            </p>
            <p>
                The world of dreams/ unconscious is the reality of this installation. Arthur Schnitzler was a writer and doctor to whom
                psychoanalysis played an important role. For 56 years he wrote down his dreams. These dream-notes, together with
                figures from other texts will be used as inspiration. The characters and their inner conflicts will be extracted from their
                stories. They meet in a universe of unconsciousness that is created in the whole building of the Aula in Fredrikstad. The
                aim is to find out if it is possible to create a waking dream in which the audience can move freely. This work will explore
                where reality and fantasy can meet and how is it possible to keep the quality and character of fantasies within reality.
                With the help of music that escapes the intellect, and transports emotions directly, the imagined result can be called an
                „installative Opera“.
